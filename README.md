This project is done for following problem statement : 
https://gist.github.com/JohnKellyFerguson/2180a661f46aa92292f1


I have commneted the code thoroughly to define the classes and variables that I am using.

Assumptions
---------------------
I am assuming that data is good. i.e. All the name symantics and email structure symantics given in the problem statement will be followed. 

Name will always consist of a first name and a last name separated by space
Email will always consist of a prefix and domain name separated by '@' character

Running Instructions
---------------------

1.  main.rb file has 2 variables as follows : 
  - Line 69 : input_dataset
  - Lint 83 : test_dataset

  Currently I am using the input and test date set given in the example on the site. You can change the datasets BUT please follow the symantics respectively

2. Tu run,
  - You must have ruby installed on the test machine
  - Copy all the files into one directory
  - Go to that directory from your terminal
  - run following command 
    $> ruby main.rb

  This command will generate the output for the given data set.
